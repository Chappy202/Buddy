## How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?
Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Chappy202/Buddy/issues/new/choose) with your report or feature request. If you would like to expand the current feature set of Buddy by coding your own extension, first open an issue for discussion. We also have a Discord server for any other issues/questions: [Discord](https://chappy202.com/discord)

## Can I self host Buddy?
Buddy wasn't designed to be self hosted. We would not recommend trying to self-host Buddy, this repository was not created to provide you with the necessary systems and tools to self host the bot, but instead to be transparent on the various systems and functions that Buddy provides, and also to possibly serve as a reference for new bot developers. We will not provide any support for editing, compiling or using the code from this repository.

## Contributing
Should you wish to contribute to the repository, you're more than welcome to open a pull request or [join our Discord](https://chappy202.com/discord) to discuss the matter. (Join the Discord first before you commit your time to improving Buddy)

## Other
Buddy has a sibling with similar features and systems that can be self hosted. This bot is known as [Bobby](https://github.com/Chappy202/Bobby). NOTE: Hosting Bobby will require you to have a reasonably good understand on how to run NodeJS applications, we will not give support to users that have never coded anything in NodeJS.
